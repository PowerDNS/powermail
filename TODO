	imap
		lot in pplistener
		ISSUE: uidls 
			need to rise monotonically and be persistent per
			message (groan)

			LAZY UIDLS!

		ISSUE: folders
			pplistener does not look in subdirectories
			autofolder creation
				is needed because nodes may be out of sync
				leads to magically appearing folders in case
				of a move

			squirrel commands missing:
				CREATE
				SUBSCRIBE
				LSUB
				
				EXPUNGE

		work:
			mimeparser

	twostep approach
		first make something that works for squirrel
			no persistent uidls
			no searches
			only special 'deleted' folder
		
	do we need a new pplistener connection per message popped?

	SpamAssassin hook
		pipe message and abort those destinations that have chosen
		spamassassin checking, afterwards

		so we need a SpamAssassinTalker!

	program delivery?
		delivery to a program, that is
		(like mailman)


	pipe-userbase

	cleanup script for growing failure logs
		lock file, copy all non-! lines, move over original
		or do so simultaneously? Hmm
