      the message was properly received. In this way, messages are always stored at at least the configured minimum redundancy.

>	      Each backend is assigned to a group. Backends within a group do not generate
	      redundancy - this can be used to make sure that email is spread over
	      different physical locations so that each site has a copy of all articles.

>	It is important to determine what targets we want to meet. PowerMail tries to
	maximize perceived uptime - users must at all times be able to access their
	mailboxes, which should contain as much of their mail as possible. Access
	to POP is never disabled.
      </P
><P
>	Mail delivery however is halted as soon as the minimum configured redundancy cannot 
	be guaranteed,
	remote mailers will have to wait until more backends become available. As
	this is not directly perceived by the user, disabling deliveries is
	preferred over allowing non-redundant deliveries.
